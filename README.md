# 3D Facial Landmark Detection
Detecting Facial Landmarks on 3D Models Based on Geometric Properties 

Face Landmark Detection algorithms on 3D Face Scans are presented along with pseudocode. Pseudocode from literature for some of the landmarks are listed as well.

This code repository includes pseudocode and Phyton implementations for the following facial landmarks:

- Alar Base Junction/Alar Crease - left/right (ac)
- Alar Rim’s Highest Point - left/right (armax)
- Alare/Alar Flare - left/right (al)
- Cheilion - left/right (ch)
- Columellar Break Point (cb)
- Columellar Rim - left/right (cmin)
- Endocanthion/Medial Canthus - left/right (en)
- Exocanthion/Lateral Canthus - left/right (ex)
- Glabella (g)
- Labiale Superius (ls)
- Lateral helix of ear - left/right (la)
- Maxillofrontale - left/right (ma)
- Menton/Gnathion (me)
- Nasal Parenthesis - left/right (np)
- Nasion/Radix (n)
- Pronasale/Tip (prn)
- Sellion
- Stomion (sto)
- Subalare - left/right (sbal)
- Subnasale - left/right
- Subnasale (sn)
- Supratip Break Point (s)
- Tip Defining Point - left/right (td)
- Trichion
- Zygion (left/right)

The algorithms assume that the face 3D models are placed in the correct pose and orientation on the x, y, and z coordinate systems, facing the z-axis.
